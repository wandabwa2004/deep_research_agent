"""Search tools used by the researcher agents.

Two Tavily tools are exposed:

- `make_search_tool()` — returns search hits (title, url, short content snippet).
  Cheap, good for discovery. Used by every agent that searches the web.

- `make_extract_tool()` — fetches the full clean text of specific URLs. Used
  by specialists after they've picked promising sources, so they can quote
  verbatim passages instead of relying on snippet text.

Both share the same `TAVILY_API_KEY`. Wrapping is intentionally thin —
agents handle filtering and citation extraction themselves.
