"""Shallow research path.

`shallow_researcher_node` runs a small ReAct loop with the Tavily tool and
produces a concise answer + citations. It self-judges sufficiency: if it could
not answer confidently, it sets `shallow_sufficient=False` so the graph escalates
to the deep path (scout → architect → ...).

`shallow_finalize_node` formats the audited shallow answer as the final report.
